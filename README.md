# Trackmon
Finance management software

## Server and API
You can find all server related stuff [here](https://github.com/trackmon/trackmon-server) and the API specification [here](https://github.com/trackmon/trackmon-api).

## Versioning
Our versioning is independent of the [API](https://github.com/trackmon/trackmon-api). Every release references an API release, so you can see easily which versions will work toghether and which not. We recommend anyone who wants to write a client (or server) to do the same. The application itself provides an API reference as well.
